# FizzBuzz
Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "Fizz", any number divisible by five with the word "Buzz" and numbers divisible by both become "FizzBuzz". 

And it is also a famous coding interview question. The text of the programming assignment is as follows:

`Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.`

Question designed to help filter out applicants, because a significant percentage of job candidates "fail" the test.
